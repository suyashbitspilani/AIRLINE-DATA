This project focuses on analyzing flight activity and on-time performance data provided by the Department of Transportation. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

Technical Specifications:

The analysis is conducted using Apache Spark (v2.4 or later) with the Quantcast File System (QFS) as the distributed file system. The code is adaptable and can be modified to use Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) if required.

This version of the airline data analysis was designed to be conducted on a resource-constrained computer cluster, such as the [ODROID XU-4 Mini-Cluster](https://diybigdata.net/odroid-xu4-cluster/).
